# Boolean values and logical operations

# Literal values
a = true
b = false

# Logical AND (→ &&)
c = true and false
d = a and b

# Logical OR (→ ||)
e = true or false
f = a or b

# Logical NOT (→ !)
g = not true
h = not a

# Combined operations
i = (a and b) or c
j = not (a or b)
k = a and not b

# With comparisons
l = (1 > 0) and (2 > 1)
m = (x == 1) or (y == 2)

# Note: "is" and "isnt" are tested in comparison.coffee
